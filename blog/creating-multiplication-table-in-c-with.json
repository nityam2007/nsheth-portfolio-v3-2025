    "content": "<h2>Creating a Multiplication Table in C: A Simple Code Explanation</h2></p><p><p><br> In the world of programming, documenting your code is crucial for understanding its functionality and maintaining it in the long run. In this blog post, we will guide you on how to document your C code effectively, providing you with a clear understanding of its structure and purpose. The aim is to create documentation that is easily readable and accessible for your future reference.<br></p></p><p><h3>Code:</h3></p><p><pre><code>#include <stdio.h></p><p>// Function to generate the multiplication table<br>void table(int n);</p><p>int main() {<br> int n;</p><p> // Prompt the user to enter a number<br> printf(\"Enter number: \");<br> scanf(\"%d\", &n);</p><p> // Call the table function to generate the multiplication table<br> table(n);</p><p> return 0;<br>}</p><p>// Function to generate the multiplication table<br>void table(int n) {<br> // Loop from 1 to 10 to generate the table<br> for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {<br> // Print the result of the multiplication<br> printf(\"%dn\", i * n);<br> }<br>} </code></pre></p><p><h3>Explanation:</h3></p><p><p><br> Let's break down the code and understand how it works. Here are the key points to note:<br></p></p><p><ul><br><li><code>table</code> function: This function takes a parameter <code>n</code>, which represents the number for which the multiplication table will be generated. It uses a loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and calculates the product of <code>i</code> and <code>n</code> using the expression <code>i * n</code>. The result is then printed using the <code>printf</code> function.</li><br><li><code>main</code> function: This function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable <code>n</code>. It then calls the <code>table</code> function, passing the value of <code>n</code> as an argument.</li><br></ul></p><p><p><br> By executing this code, you will be able to see the multiplication table for the entered number on the console.<br></p></p><p><h3>Conclusion:</h3></p><p><p><br> Documenting your C code is an essential practice for maintaining code readability and understanding. By following the tips mentioned above and incorporating clear comments, you can make your code more accessible and easier to comprehend. Taking the time to document your code effectively will save you valuable time and effort in the long run.<br></p></p><p><p><br> Remember, proper documentation is a valuable resource for yourself as you revisit your code in the future. Happy coding!<br></p>",
