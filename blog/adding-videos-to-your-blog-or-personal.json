This could help them make more friends with people who are from other parts of the world. Ever since the internet was introduced, it has taken over our lives, and we now carry out every possible activity on this platform. If a person creates a personal space on the internet or is into blogging, they can promote work and browse for funny images and watch funny video clips. Not only do they make you popular among your peer group, but this is also a way to share new websites with each other.</p><p>Blogging has become a rage these days, with almost everyone owning a blog URL, which is like a personal diary, except it is maintained online. For some, it is a way to express their inner feelings and jot them down daily. For others, it’s a platform that allows them to showcase their talent and invite new business opportunities; these people are referred to as Bloggers. When we surf the net, we look for humor-related sites or those that have funny pictures and videos in them. This is a way to break the monotony of the busy day and enjoy those few moments of laughter. Many sites have funny videos in them, and if a person desires, they can embed these videos into personal blogs. All they have to do is copy the HTML tag given with the video and post it on their blog, and it will remain up there for all visitors who stop by and enjoy a good laugh.</p><p>Among the many networking sites that have come about, MySpace is the third most popular in the United States and the sixth in the world. A place where you can make friends, get to know people from across the world, impart information about you, and look for job options is what this is. You can put up your blog URL, any pictures, and funny videos you wish to share with others, and they would get noticed instantly. It is a way of drawing attention to oneself through which the member can leverage the features offered at MySpace.</p><p>The Flash videos available on various sites are videos created as Windows Media or MPEG files and later converted to Flash. The reason Flash players are the new wave in video media is that they offer more GUIs than the old players. GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. Simply put, the controls you see in Flash players are created in Flash and are unlimited. Flash players are also very popular because most computers have a built-in Flash player, making these videos available to everyone online.</p><p>Once you have embedded the code onto your page, you can watch your favorite funny video clips by simply clicking on the screenshot on the page. The Flash player also enables viewers to navigate to the source link to watch more funny videos. The same applies to those crazy funny pictures that capture hilarious moments in time. Why not share your crazy pictures with groups all over the world by uploading them to your blog or favorite social networking site? Venues like MySpace and blogs allow users to join groups based on subjects of their preference and share their funny images and videos with their friends. It is human nature to want to share, especially good, funny things, and that is exactly what these sites offer. It only takes a few minutes to leave your impression of humor on thousands of people online.</p><p>Keywords: funny videos, flash games, funny pictures, movie clip, flash</p>",
